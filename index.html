<!--I used AI as a coding assistant to help debug and refine the CSS animations used in this project, specifically the neon glow and blinking text effects.
The AI helped identify syntax issues, improve animation timing, and suggest clearer keyframe structures.
I made the final decisions on how the animations should look and integrated the code into my overall layout and design concept.-->
